# Kate Mendoza Personal Website

This features both my HTML (index.html) and CSS (websitelayout.css) files used for my personal website. It aims to showcase my web developer skills.


## HTML Structure (index.html)

The website is a single-page application that has four distinct components of a website and includes five distinct sections:

1) **topnav**:  The main navigation bar at the top of the page. It links to the different sections of the website ('home', 'about', 'skills', 'projects', 'contact').
2) **header**: To clearly label each sections of the webpage.
3) **Main or content section**
    - *Home:* Features an image and a brief description
    - *About:* Provides a short information of my background and journey into web development.
    - *Skills:* Shows icons of my technical skills.
    - *Projects:* Shows some of my web development projects.
    - *Contact:* Includes a message area in order to contact me.
4) **footer**:  It contains links to my social media and shows copyright information.

Each section is further layered using container elements and custom elements for CSS styling.

## CSS Styling (websitelayout.css)

The 'websitelayout.css' file provides the styling for the website. It includes:

- General styling for text, images, icons, forms, margins, layout, and background color 
- Hover effects and animations
- Responsive design for different screens
- Flexbox are extensively used for layout


## Limitations

* The responsive design is handled primarily by media query for screens under 600px width.
* Submit button in the contact page does not submit the form.
* Footer links are not the actual links to my social media.
